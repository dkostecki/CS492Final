			<h4 id="cat1_topic1">
					A. What This Agreement Covers
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />This Agreement between you and Bank of America, N.A (Bank of America) governs the use of Online Banking services and the Transfers Outside Bank of America service. These services permit U.S.-based Bank of America customers (consumers and business customers who are account owners) to perform a number of banking functions through the use of a personal computer or, for some functions, a mobile device (e.g., tablet or Smartphone), on accounts linked to the service, including some with our affiliates, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&amp;S"). Unless indicated otherwise by the context, "linked Bank of America accounts" or "linked accounts" refers to all of your U.S.-based accounts with Bank of America that you have linked to Online Banking or Transfers Outside Bank of America. When used in this Agreement, the term &ldquo;business&rdquo; includes sole proprietors, non-consumer business entities, and individual owners of the business, unless the context indicates otherwise.</p>

			<h4 id="cat1_topic2">
					B. Accepting the Agreement
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />When you use any of the Online Banking services described in this Agreement or Transfers Outside Bank of America, or authorize others to use them, you agree to the terms and conditions of the entire Agreement.</p>

			<h4 id="cat1_topic3">
					C. Relation to Other Agreements
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />Your use of Online Banking services or Transfers Outside Bank of America may also be affected by a deposit or other agreement between us for your linked Bank of America accounts. When you link an account to Online Banking services or Transfers Outside Bank of America, you do not change the agreements you already have with us for that account. For example, if you link a MLPF&amp;S investment account to Online Banking, the terms and conditions of your MLPF&amp;S customer agreement(s) and/or user agreement(s) do not change. Similarly, when you use Online Banking services to access a credit account, you do so under the terms and conditions we gave you in the agreement and disclosure for the credit account. You should review those and other Bank of America account-related&nbsp;agreements and fee schedules for any applicable fees, for limitations on the number of transactions you can make, liability rules for electronic fund transfers, and for other restrictions that might impact your use of an account with Online Banking services or Transfers Outside Bank of America.</p>

					E. Online Banking Alerts
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />We provide three types of Online Banking Alerts:</p>
<ol>
<li>General &amp; Security Alerts are sent to you following important account activities or when certain changes are made online to your Online Banking account, such as a change in your email or home address, telephone number, Online ID or passcode, insufficient funds, or irregular card activity. You do not need to activate these alerts. We automatically activate them for you. Although you have the option to suppress these General &amp; Security&nbsp;Alerts, we strongly recommend that you do not do so since they provide important information related to your online security or account activities.</li>
<li class="mtop-15">Account Alerts, which&nbsp;must be activated by you.
<ul class="tc-disc" style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Account Alerts allow you to choose optional alert messages for your accounts.</li>
<li>Each Account Alert has different options available, and you will be asked to select from among these options upon activation of an Account Alert.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic Alerts are sent to your primary email address only and provide you with important account notifications, such as information about a money transfer&nbsp; or availability of an eStatement.&nbsp;
<ul class="tc-disc" style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>You do not have the option to suppress these Automatic Alerts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alerts are subject to the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="tc-disc" style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>We may add new Alerts from time to time, or cancel old alerts. We usually notify you when we cancel alerts, but are not obligated to do so.</li>
<li>Alerts will be sent to the email address you have provided as your primary email address for Online Banking. For General &amp; Security and Account Alerts you can also choose to have&nbsp;these sent to a secondary email address, a mobile device that accepts text messages, or a mobile device that can receive our Mobile App Alerts through a push notification system. If your email address or your mobile device's number changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. While Bank of America does not charge for the delivery of the alerts, please be advised that text or data charges or rates may be imposed by your carrier. Your alerts will be updated to reflect the changes that you communicate to us with regard to your primary and secondary email addresses or mobile device number.</li>
<li>We do our best to provide alerts in a timely manner with accurate information, but alerts may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors beyond our control (such as system failures or misdirected delivery). We don't guarantee the delivery or accuracy of alerts. The contents of an alert may be outdated by the time an alert is sent or received, due to other activity on your account or to delays in sending data among various systems. You agree that we are not liable for any delays, failure to deliver, or misdirected delivery of any alert; for any errors in the content of an alert or for any actions taken or not taken by you or a third party as the result of an alert.</li>
<li>Because alerts are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode or full account number. However, alerts may include your name and some information about your accounts. Depending upon the type of alert, information such as your account&nbsp;balance, transaction information or the due date for your credit card, charge card and/or business line of credit payment may be included. Anyone with access to your alerts will be able to view the contents of these messages.</li>

<li>Transfers can be made in 2 ways, on a 1-time or recurring basis. One-time transfers may be immediate or scheduled for a future date. The recurring transfer feature may be used when a set amount is transferred at regular intervals. For example, a $100 transfer from a checking to a savings account which occurs every 2 weeks.</li>
<li>One-time immediate transfers can be made from a linked Bank of America checking, savings, money market, line of credit, credit card, charge card, business line of credit or brokerage account to most linked Bank of America accounts.</li>
<li>Scheduled and recurring transfers can be made from a linked Bank of America checking, savings, money market, credit card, charge card or business line of credit account to a linked checking or savings account.</li>
<li>Scheduled and recurring transfers can be made between a linked MLPF&amp;S investment account and a linked Bank of America checking, savings or money market account.</li>
<li>Transfers can be made from a linked Bank of America personal or small business checking, savings, money market or line of credit account to most personal or small business checking, savings, or money market accounts of other Bank of America customers. Some account types, including those with foreign addresses, cannot be set up to receive funds.</li>
<li>Transfers from a deposit account (excluding investment accounts) are immediately reflected in the account's available balance. Transfers from a credit card, charge card, business line of credit or a line of credit account are immediately reflected in the account's available credit amount. Transfers from a MLPF&amp;S investment account are immediately reflected in the account's available balance.</li>

<li>Scheduled and Recurring Transfers

<ul class="tc-circle">
<li>Funds transferred as a payment to a credit card, charge card, business line of credit, line of credit, installment loan or mortgage account before 11:59 p.m. ET will be credited with the date the payment is submitted.

<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>Payments can be scheduled from linked checking, money market savings, and HELOC accounts. (Does not apply to HELOC accounts opened in Texas or SafeBalance Banking<sup>TM</sup> accounts.)</li>

We will also notify you if your account is no longer in good standing and eligible to be used for bill payments. As indicated above, some payments may be made by a personal check.

					C. Email/Mobile Transfer Network Service 
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />1. <strong>Description of Service and Consent</strong><br />Email/Mobile Transfers allows you to send money from your Bank of America checking or savings account or requests for money to another Bank of America customer or a customer of another U.S. based bank by using a recipient's email address or mobile phone number. Another Bank of America customer or a customer of a different U.S. based bank may also send money to your account or a request for money using your email address or mobile phone number. In order to send or receive money transfers or requests for money, you must register through Online Banking from your personal computer or Mobile Banking from your mobile device. Recipients of your money transfers or requests for money must also register with Bank of America or another participating bank or with ClearXChange<sup>TM</sup>, a company that arranges electronic money transfers. Once registered, you may send a money transfer or request for money using Online Banking or Mobile Banking by entering the email address or mobile phone number of the recipient. Money sent to your email address or mobile number will be deposited into the account you designated when you registered for the service. By participating in Email/Mobile Transfers, you are representing to us that you are the owner or you have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the mobile phone number or email address you are using to send or receive messages regarding money transfers and requests for money. In addition, you are consenting to the receipt of emails or automated text messages from Bank of America, or its agent, regarding money transfers or requests for money and represent to us that you have obtained the consent of the recipients of your intended transfers to the receipt of such emails or automated text messages.</p>
<p>Requests For Money<br />By participating in Email/Mobile Transfers, you also have the option of sending a request for money to other people with whom you are splitting a bill or are requesting reimbursement. You may also receive a request for money from other people, which you can respond to by sending money or declining the request. By participating in Email/Mobile Transfers, you agree to receive money requests from others and to only send requests for legitimate and lawful purposes. Requests for money are solely between the sender and recipient and are not reviewed or verified by Bank of America. Bank of America assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or legality of such requests and does not act as a debt collector on your behalf or on behalf of the sender of a request for money. Bank of America reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to terminate your ability to send requests for money in general, or to specific recipients, if it deems such requests to be potentially unlawful, abusive, offensive or unwelcome by the recipient.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Scheduling Transfers</strong><br />Once registered, you may make one-time transfers at any time using Online Banking or Mobile Banking by entering the email address or mobile phone number of the recipient. An unregistered recipient must register within 14 days and set up the same email address or mobile phone number that you entered to send them money. If the recipient does not register, set up an email address or mobile number and accept the transfer within 14 days, the transaction will be cancelled. During this period, a hold will be placed on the sender's account for the amount of the transfer. Once the recipient has successfully enrolled in the Email/Mobile Transfer Network, transfers will automatically be debited from the sender's account and deposited in the recipient's account. If the sender and recipient are both Bank of America customers enrolled in the Email/Mobile Transfer Network, transfers will be immediately debited from the sender's account and reflected in the recipient's account in accordance with the time frames indicated in Transfers to Deposit Accounts in Section 3.A. If both parties are enrolled in the Email/Mobile Transfer Network but you are sending money to a customer of a different bank, the transfer will be immediately debited from your account and, if completed by 9:00 p.m. ET, will be delivered to the recipient's bank within three business days. Bank of America is not responsible for any failure of another bank to timely credit its customer's account. The transfer process for funds sent to you using your email address or mobile number generally takes approximately four business days, subject to the terms of the sender's agreement with its bank. Bank of America will deposit the funds into your designated account when the transfer has settled and the funds are available.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that payment transfers will be completed using only the email address or mobile phone number you enter even if it identifies a person different from your intended recipient. The name you enter will help you identify your intended recipient in the drop down menu and your transaction history but will not be used to process payments. Please make sure you accurately enter the recipient's email address or mobile phone number since your obligation to pay for the transfer will not be excused by an error in the information you enter.</p>
<p>Transfer Instructions relating to external accounts and the transmission and issuance of data related to such Instructions shall be received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association ("NACHA") and the applicable automated clearing house ("Regional ACH") (collectively, the "Rules") and you and we agree to be bound by such Rules as in effect from time to time. In accordance with such Rules, any credit to an account shall be provisional until such credit has been finally settled by us or the third party institution which holds the account.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Fees<br /></strong>There is no fee for sending or receiving a transfer under the Email/Mobile Transfer Service. Please note that your mobile carrier may charge you for text messaging. Please check your mobile service agreement for details on applicable fees.</p>
<p>You may also make payments without a transaction fee by using Bill Pay (described in Section 3.B above). Bill Pay allows you to transfer money to individuals, regardless of whether they are Bank of America customers, usually within 4 business days. You may also make transfers without charge to other Bank of America customers through online banking if you know the recipient's account number.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Mobile Carrier Information<br /></strong>By registering a mobile phone number through the enrollment process, you are certifying that you are the account holder for the mobile phone account or have the account holder's permission to register the number.</p>
<p><strong>Message &amp; data rates may apply. For help text "HELP" to 53849. To cancel your plan, send a text "STOP" to 53849 at anytime.</strong></p>
<p>After you text "STOP", you agree to receive one additional text message confirming your choice.</p>

<p><br />We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we have sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared (or 90 days if the problem or error relates to a bill payment from an account maintained at another financial institution).<br />If you tell us verbally, we may require you to send us your complaint or question in writing or via email within ten (10) bank business days (Online Banking customers may use secure online mail).

					B. Limitation of Liability for Online Banking Transactions
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />Tell us at once if you believe your Online Banking passcode has been compromised or if someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account without your permission. The best way to minimize your loss is to call us immediately. The unauthorized use of your Online Banking services could cause you to lose all of your money in your accounts, plus any amount available under your overdraft protection plan.<br /><br />You will have no liability for unauthorized transactions if you notify us within 60 days after the statement showing the transaction has been mailed to you (or 90 days if the transaction was from an account maintained at another financial institution). If you do not, you may not get back any of the money you lost from any unauthorized transaction that occurs after the close of the 60-day period (or 90 day period if the transaction was from an account maintained at another financial institution), if we can show that we could have stopped the transaction if you had notified us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods. <br /><br />When you give someone your Online Banking ID and passcode, you are authorizing that person to use your service, and you are responsible for all transactions that person performs while using your service. All transactions that person performs, even those transactions you did not intend or want performed, are authorized transactions.<br /><br />Transactions that you or someone acting with you initiates with fraudulent intent are also authorized transactions.<br /><br />For your protection, sign off after every Online Banking session and close your browser to ensure confidentiality.<br /><br />Note: These liability rules are established by Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and does not apply to business accounts. Our liability policy regarding unauthorized debit card or ATM Card transactions, and unauthorized Online Banking transactions on consumer deposit accounts may give you more protection, provided you report the transactions promptly. Please see the agreement you received with your ATM or debit card and the Online Banking agreement. Also, the state law applicable to your account may give you more time to report an unauthorized transaction or may give you more protection. For example, in Massachusetts, the two day and 60 day time limits for reporting unauthorized transactions do not apply and the $500 limit does not apply.</p>

			</h4>

<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>If, through no fault of ours, you don't have enough available funds in your account (or available funds under your overdraft protection plan), or credit to cover the transaction or transfer</li>
<li>If Online Banking services weren't working properly, and you knew about the malfunction when you started the transaction or transfer</li>
<li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevented the transaction or transfer, despite reasonable precautions we've taken</li>

					A. Protecting Passcodes
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />You agree that we may send notices and other communications, including passcode confirmations, to the current address shown in our records, whether or not that address includes a designation for delivery to the attention of any particular individual. You further agree that Bank of America will not be responsible or liable to you in any way if information is intercepted by an unauthorized person, either in transit or at your place of business. You agree to: 1) keep your passcode secure and strictly confidential, providing it only to authorized signers on your account(s); 2) instruct each person to whom you give your passcode that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person; and 3) immediately notify us and select a new passcode if you believe your passcode may have become known to an unauthorized person. <strong>Bank of America will have no liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using your passcode that occurs before you have notified us of possible unauthorized use and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice.</strong> We may suspend or cancel your passcode even without receiving such notice from you, if we suspect your passcode is being used in an unauthorized or fraudulent manner. For businesses who use the additional services described in Section 7, this section applies to all Online Banking passcodes, including those assigned to users or Administrators. You are responsible for all transactions performed by you and any designated user(s), including Administrator(s), whether you specifically authorize the transactions or not. If you notify us that the person is no longer authorized, then only transactions that person performs after the time you notify us are considered unauthorized.</p>

					C. Limitation of Bank's Liability (does not apply to Transfers Outside Bank of America or Direct Payments Service)
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />If we fail or delay in making a payment or transfer pursuant to your instructions, or if we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that is less than the amount per your instructions, unless otherwise required by law, our liability shall be limited to interest on the amount that we failed to timely pay or transfer, calculated from the date on which the payment or transfer was to be made until the date it was actually made or you canceled the instructions. We may pay such interest either to you or the intended recipient of the payment or transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both parties, and our payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other. If we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that exceeds the amount per your instructions, or if we permit an unauthorized payment or transfer after we have had a reasonable time to act on a notice from you of possible unauthorized use as described above, unless otherwise required by law, our liability will be limited to a refund of the amount erroneously paid or transferred, plus interest thereon from the date of the payment or transfer to the date of the refund, but in no event to exceed 60 days' interest. If we become liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where Bank of America is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year. <strong>Unless otherwise required by law, in no event will Bank of America be liable to you for special, indirect or consequential damages including, without limitation, lost profits or attorney's fees, even if we are advised in advance of the possibility of such damages.</strong></p>
<p>For the provisions governing our liability for Transfers Outside Bank of America, please see Section 8.G below. For the provisions governing our liability for Direct Payments Service, please see Section 4.G of the Online Business Suite Addendum.<br />Please note that if you give or make reasonably available, your PIN or other access device or code to anyone, you may be liable for any use made of such until you advise us that such person is not authorized to use them.</p>

				7. Additional Services Intended for Businesses
		</h3>
	</div>
	
		<p>The additional services described in this Section 7 are available only if you also enroll in the Online Business Suite or if you are a payroll customer. Some customers have been provided continued access to these services without enrolling in the Online Business Suite. We have notified you separately if you qualified for this limited exception.</p>
		<div class="h-100">
			<h4 id="cat7_topic1">
					A. Creating and Managing Users
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />You may authorize other users and control their scope of activities by designating user levels, access levels, and account settings.</p>
<p>You may add additional users to your Online Banking profile and provide each with a separate Online ID and passcode. You may designate the user level either as, &ldquo;user&rdquo; (also sometimes referred to as sub-user) or &ldquo;Administrator.&rdquo; An Administrator is a user who is able to create additional users and to edit and monitor other users. An Administrator is not eligible to enroll in other online business services or grant levels of access to other users that have not been granted to the Administrator. For each user, you can designate which account(s) the user will have access to. You may also place limits on the types of transactions for each account the user is granted access to.</p>
<p>For each account linked to your Online Banking profile, except for personal investment accounts, you can designate each user&rsquo;s access level and account settings.</p>
<p>Access Level (also sometimes referred to as Activity Level) means either Transactional Access, View Access or No Access.</p>
<p>You agree that users have Transactional Access, unless otherwise specified by you or an Administrator. You agree that by granting Transactional Access (also sometimes referred to as financial access or full access) to an account you will be allowing a user to transfer funds, make payments, perform account maintenance, and view account balances and activity on the account, subject to the selected account or general service settings.</p>
<p>View Access (also sometimes referred to as inquiry access or basic access) allows a user to only view account balances and activity, subject to the selected account or general service settings.</p>
<p>Account settings are levels of access and transactional limits that you and/or an Administrator may select for each user. In addition to specifying Transactional, View, or No Access for a user of an account, you can also specify certain other account settings, including transaction limitations as provided on our web site. You may also designate certain &ldquo;general service settings,&rdquo; which are global settings that may affect more than one account. These include Full Access Bill Pay, Payroll Services, Direct Payments, and Express Invoicing.</p>
<p>There are additional controls available for the Bill Pay option. If you select to enable Full Access Bill Pay for a user, that user will automatically have Transactional Access to all the accounts that you have set up for Bill Pay, and the user will be able to pay bills using the Bill Pay feature and set up new payees. You may, however, designate limited access for a user of Bill pay, which will permit the user to have transactional access for specific accounts and existing payees only. For the Bill Pay functionality, you may limit a user to use only certain specified accounts. For users of the Payroll, Direct Payments and Express Invoicing, only Transaction Access is available.</p>
<p>In addition to designating general service settings, you can also provide additional account settings on certain eligible accounts, such as allowing a user to view statements, view check images or make transfers for the selected accounts. Any user to whom you have given transfer ability will be able to see the last name and last 4 digits of account number for all transfer recipients created by you, an Administrator or any other user, even those that the user did not initiate.</p>
<p>If you no longer are a person authorized on the signature card for each linked account to designate signers for each such account, the business has the obligation to inform Business Online Banking of the new individual or individuals with such authority. Such notice must be given separately from any other notices given to other Bank of America departments or banking centers, by calling us at 1.800.933.6262. You may also write us at:</p>
<p><strong>Bank of America<br />FL1-300-02-07<br />P.O. Box 25118<br />Tampa,&nbsp;FL 33622-5118</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for (and we will have no liability to you for) any unauthorized payments, transfers or other transactions performed on any account linked to this service that are made by a designated user or Administrator using the Passcodes you or an Administrator assign, and that occur before you have notified us of possible unauthorized use and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice.</p>

					B. Linking Accounts of Additional Businesses and Personal Accounts
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />If you also are authorized to enter into an Agreement for the Business Online Banking service for another business, and if you want to link the accounts of the other business to the accounts covered by this Agreement, you will need to agree separately to this Agreement for each other business. Upon doing so, you may link the accounts of the businesses so that you may elect, at your risk and that of the businesses, but not of the Bank, to use a common Online ID and passcode for Business Online Banking for all linked accounts. You should do this only if you are authorized to link the accounts of the different business and to use all the functions of Business Online Banking for each business. You further agree to inform Bank of America if your authority over any linked account decreases. Bank of America is not liable if your authority over any account decreases until it is informed of the change in authority using the "Notice" requirements of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You may also link an eligible Bank of America personal account to the accounts covered by this Agreement. SafeBalance Banking<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;accounts are not eligible to be linked to Online Business Suite accounts. You may link eligible accounts only&nbsp;if you are the named owner of the business account and the personal account. If you link personal accounts to your business accounts, you agree and understand that users and Administrators will be able to view and/or perform transactions with linked personal accounts, subject to the selected account or general service settings described in Section 7.A. above.</p>
<p>You further agree to inform Bank of America if your authority over any linked account decreases. Bank of America is not liable if your authority over any account decreases until it is informed of the change in authority using the "Notice" requirements of this Agreement.</p>

					D. Business Payroll Services
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><strong>For payroll customers who have accepted the Intuit terms and conditions on or after May 31, 2013, the following terms and conditions in subsection 7.D apply to your Online Banking Agreement with us:</strong></p>
<p>1. Self Service or Full Service</p>
<p>Bank of America has arranged for a third-party provider, Intuit Inc., to furnish optional web-based payroll processing services (the &ldquo;Payroll Service&rdquo;) to our online business customers. You can choose a self-service product (Intuit&reg; Online Payroll) that permits you to perform your own payroll, or you can choose a full service version (Intuit Full Service Payroll&reg;) where Intuit will perform your payroll for you.</p>
<p>This is a summary of current terms of the Intuit Payroll Services for business customers enrolling in and/or navigating to the Payroll Service through Bank of America Small Business Online Banking:</p>
<p>Intuit&reg; Online Payroll: Intuit Online Payroll&reg; offers two service levels, Basic and Enhanced. Enhanced service provides state and multi-state tax service and direct deposit to banks other than Bank of America.&nbsp; Monthly fees: Basic service is $20/month and Enhanced service is $36/month. With Basic, you will receive a $20 discount in any month you pay all your employees (includes contractors) by direct deposit to Bank of America accounts. For both Enhanced and Basic, if you pay more than 20 employees, but not all are paid by direct deposits to Bank of America accounts, an additional monthly fee of $2 will be charged for each employee over the first 20. The monthly payroll service fees are waived during the first 3 months of enrollment. Intuit guarantees the accuracy of its payroll tax calculations, based on the information you provide and subject to the terms of your agreement with Intuit. If Intuit causes a calculation error, Intuit will pay the tax penalty incurred as a result of a calculation error.</p>
<p>Intuit Full Service Payroll&reg;: Monthly fees: $99/month, plus $2 for each employee (includes contractor). Intuit guarantees the accuracy of the payroll tax calculations, tax filings, and any paychecks Intuit prepares for you, based on the information you provide and subject to the terms of your agreement with Intuit. If Intuit causes a service error, Intuit will pay the tax penalty, pay the resulting bank fees, and waive the next month&rsquo;s service fee.</p>
<p>Both Intuit&reg; Online Payroll&reg; and Intuit Full Service Payroll: Additional multi-state payroll processing fees ($12/state/month for IOP and $10/state/month for IFSP) will apply for every state in which you have employees (or contractors), other than your primary business state location. Monthly service fees, including multi-state fees, apply each month in which you are enrolled, whether or not you use the service. Additional fees for exception processing and other special services may apply. Pricing does not include applicable taxes. You must have an open Bank of America business checking account to be eligible to access the payroll service through Bank of America Online Banking. The maximum number of active employees and contractors being paid cannot exceed 150.</p>
<p><br />Intuit&reg; Online Payroll and Intuit Full Service Payroll&reg; are products of Intuit Inc. You must go to the Intuit Website to enroll in and use the payroll product. Bank of America is not responsible for the product or the performance of Intuit Inc. Intuit and the Intuit Logo are registered trademarks of Intuit Inc., used under license.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Terms, conditions, features, availability, pricing, fees, service and support options are subject to change. The actual terms and conditions of your Payroll Service are in the service agreement you execute with Intuit, Inc. Bank of America makes no representation or warranty concerning the accuracy or continuance of any of the these terms, whether shown in this agreement, on the Bank of America website, or on any other Bank of America communication.</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Enrollment and Navigation.</p>
<p>You must navigate to the Intuit website to enroll and to use the Payroll Services. You will be subject to the Intuit terms and conditions, privacy, and security agreements and policies. Intuit may decline to initiate the Payroll Service for you or any of your employees in its sole discretion. The Payroll Services are not Bank of America services or products, and Bank of America is not responsible for the Payroll Services or the performance of Intuit.</p>
<p><br />We provide a link from your Bank of America Small Business Online Banking session for you to access your Payroll Service on the Intuit Web Site, which you are permitted to use if you maintain a Bank of America business checking account.&nbsp; This will enable you to simultaneously work in both sessions as permitted by the applicable service agreements; however, there will be no download or transfer of your account information or data from the Bank of America website to the Intuit website except as described herein. When you navigate from the Bank of America site to the Intuit web site you hereby authorize us to transmit to Intuit the necessary identification and security information concerning you and your authorized users. You acknowledge that Bank of America may market its products and services to your employees whose information we have received from you in order for us to facilitate access to the Payroll Service.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Disclaimer of Warranties.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BANK OF AMERICA AND ITS AGENTS, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, ADVERTISERS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS, EXCEPT FOR INTUIT, INC., DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PAYROLL SERVICE AND ITS RELATED MATERIALS, INCLUDING THEIR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THEIR QUALITY, THEIR MERCHANTABILITY, OR THEIR NON-INFRINGEMENT. BANK OF AMERICA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE IS COMPLETELY SECURE OR IS FREE FROM BUGS, INTERRUPTIONS, ERRORS, OR OTHER PROGRAM LIMITATIONS. BANK OF AMERICA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE WEB SITE, OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE, IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU (AND NOT BANK OF AMERICA) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION OF PROBLEMS CAUSED BY VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF THE SERVICE. HOWEVER, SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SUPERSEDES THE LIABILITY LIMITATION SECTION OF THE ONLINE BANKING AGREEMENT (6.C.) ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYROLL SERVICE. THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF BANK OF AMERICA AND ITS AGENTS, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, ADVERTISERS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS, EXCEPT FOR INTUIT, INC., FOR ANY REASON SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SERVICE FEES PAID BY YOU TO BANK OF AMERICA DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE CLAIM ACCRUED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BANK OF AMERICA AND ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, ADVERTISERS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS, EXCEPT FOR INTUIT, INC., ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS OR INVESTMENT, OR THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH IN THIS ADDENDUM IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BANK OF AMERICA AND ITS AGENTS, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, ADVERTISERS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS, EXCEPT FOR INTUIT, INC., ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, ERASURE OR CORRUPTION OF OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION TRANSMITTED, PROCESSED OR STORED VIA THE SERVICE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION AND/OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that if an employee of yours is paid by check through the Payroll Service, and the employee does not have a deposit account with Bank of America, the employee may be charged a fee to cash that check at a Bank of America location.&nbsp; You further acknowledge that some states require an employer to provide its employees with the means to obtain the full value of their paychecks.&nbsp; You agree that compliance with any such requirement is your responsibility and not the responsibility of Bank of America or Intuit, and you indemnify and hold harmless Bank of America and Intuit for any claim asserting a violation of such requirement.</p>
<p>The limitations of damages and liability set forth in this Section are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Bank of America and you. You acknowledge and agree that Bank of America would not be able to provide your access to the Payroll Service on an economic basis without such limitations.</p>

					A. Transfers Outside Bank of America for Online Banking Customers
			</h4>
		</div>
			<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>You must be enrolled in Online Banking to use the Transfers Outside Bank of America Service.</li>
<li>Within Online Banking, you have the option of participating in the Transfers Outside Bank of America Service which allows you to transfer funds between your linked personal deposit accounts at Bank of America and certain deposit or investment accounts owned by you or someone else at other financial institutions using an account number and financial institution identifier. An inbound transfer moves funds into an account you own at Bank of America from an account you own outside Bank of America. An outbound transfer moves funds from an account you own at Bank of America to an account outside Bank of America that is owned by you or someone else.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Small Business customers may transfer funds from their business checking account to an individual's or vendor's account at another financial institution. Before scheduling a transfer to an individual, you agree that you will have received a signed authorization from the payee, and that the authorization will not have been revoked. You agree to provide a copy of the authorization to us upon our request. Before scheduling any vendor payment, you agree that you will have received authorization from the vendor to make the payment by electronic means.</li>
<li>You will need to provide certain identifying information about each non-Bank of America account in order to register that account for this service. For inbound transfers, you agree that you will only attempt to register non-Bank of America personal accounts that you own or for which you have the authority to transfer funds. Delivery speeds for domestic (U.S.) transfers are 3-Business-Day, Next-Business-Day or Same-Business-Day transfers. Same-Business-Day transfers are not available for inbound transfers. Transfers to accounts located outside the United States are available for outbound transfers only and are subject to the delivery times indicated below. Next-Business-Day and Three-Business-Day transfers are not available for international transfers. Please see below for a more detailed description of these transfers.</li>
<li>Types of domestic (U.S.) outbound transfers:
<ul class="tc-circle">
<li>Three-Business-Day transfers: Funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer, and typically will be credited to the receiving account on the third business day after the transfer is initiated.</li>
<li>Next-Business-Day transfers: Funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer, and typically will be credited to the receiving account on the next business day after the transfer is initiated.</li>
<li>Same-Business-Day transfers: Funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer and typically will be credited to the receiving account on the same business day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of domestic (U.S.) inbound transfers:
<ul class="tc-circle">
<li>Three-Business-Day transfers: Funds typically will be debited from your account outside Bank of America on the business day or next business day after you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer, and will be credited to your Bank of America personal account on the third business day after the transfer is initiated.</li>
<li>Next-Business-Day transfers: Funds typically will be debited from your account outside Bank of America on the business day or next business day after you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer, and will be credited to your Bank of America personal account on the next business day after the transfer is initiated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of international outbound transfers:
<ul class="tc-circle">
<li>For all international outbound transfers, funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you direct us to initiate processing of the transfer.&nbsp;Bank of America will send the payment out on that business day and, except for Remittance Transfers, the beneficiary&rsquo;s bank typically receives the funds 1 to 2 business days later and the funds typically will be credited to the beneficiary within 2 days.</li>
<li>Special rules apply to Remittance Transfers, including, but not limited to, disclosures, cancellation and refund rights and error resolution rights. See Section 8.H below for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of the above services may not be available for certain accounts, customers, or if you access Online Banking through Mobile Banking Apps or Mobile Web.</li>
<li>Bank of America cannot guarantee the timely delivery or return of funds as a result of the failure of another financial institution to act in a timely manner. Please note that beneficiary banks located in some countries may take several days or even weeks to credit the receiving account. There may be some risk in making a transfer to a slow-to-pay country. Currency conversion charges also may apply to international outbound transfers. Bank of America will trace your transfer if the recipient has not received it in 3 weeks. A $25 fee will be charged for each transfer trace.</li>
<li>You agree that you will have sufficient available funds in the designated deposit account to cover all outbound transfers on the date scheduled. If a SafeBalance Banking<sup>TM</sup> account does not have sufficient funds available on the scheduled transfer date, the transfer will not be made. For other deposit accounts (excluding SafeBalance Banking<sup>TM</sup>), if the account does not have sufficient available funds on the scheduled date, we may elect not to initiate one or more of the transfers. If we do elect to initiate the transfer, it may cause an overdraft in your account in which case you shall be liable for the overdraft and any overdraft fees and interest thereon, as set forth in your Deposit Agreement. If we do elect to initiate the transfer, you agree to pay all related fees as disclosed in your Deposit Agreement.</li>
<li>You agree that Bank of America may use any means or routes which we in our sole discretion consider suitable to execute your transfer. Bank of America hereby gives notice that Same-Business-Day domestic transfers and international outbound transfers may be executed through Fedwire, a funds transfer system operated by the Federal Reserve Banks, through CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payments System), a funds transfer system operated by The Clearing House or through SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through Fedwire, Federal Reserve Regulation J and all applicable Federal Reserve operating rules&nbsp;shall govern the payment orders. With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through CHIPS, the CHIPS Operating Rules shall govern the payment orders. With respect to payment orders relating to the transfer which are executed through SWIFT, the SWIFT operating rules shall govern the payment orders. However, with respect to Remittance Transfers, to the extent of any inconsistencies between the above referenced rules and the provisions of the EFTA, the provisions of EFTA shall prevail.&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the rights and obligations that apply to Remittance Transfers are set forth in the EFTA and, as applicable, as set forth in New York law. Three-Business-Day transfers and Next-Business-Day transfers may be made through the Automated Clearing House processor selected by us or directly to another bank, and you agree will be subject to the National Automated Clearing House Association rules or our agreement with the other bank, in effect at such time, as applicable.</li>

<li>Domestic inbound or outbound transfers can be scheduled on either an immediate, 1-time future-dated or a recurring basis. Processing of 1-time domestic transfers may be initiated immediately or scheduled for initiation on a future date. International outbound transfers may only be initiated for immediate transfer. Recurring transfers may be scheduled for up to 1 year in advance for domestic (U.S.) transfers only. The recurring transfer feature may be used when a set amount is transferred at regular intervals. For example, you may schedule a $100 transfer from an account you own at another financial institution to your Bank of America checking account every 2 weeks.</li>
<li>In addition to choosing the delivery speed, as described above, for domestic transfers you will be asked to pick the date that you want us to initiate the processing of the transfer. For example, if you direct us to initiate processing an outbound transfer immediately and choose Next Business Day delivery, funds will be debited from your Bank of America account on the business day you schedule the transfer and typically will be credited to the receiving account on the next business day after the transfer is initiated.</li>
<li>1-time future-dated or recurring transfers scheduled for a weekend or a non business day will be processed on the prior business day.</li>

					C. Cancelling Transfers
			</h4>
		</div>
			<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>Except for Remittance Transfers, you can cancel 1-time future-dated and recurring domestic transfers prior to midnight ET on the date processing for the transfer is scheduled to be initiated by accessing the Transfers page and selecting To/From my accounts at other banks or To someone else&nbsp;or business within Online Banking. This is the preferred method for cancelling transfers. After you cancel a future-dated transfer, the status changes to Canceled.</li>
<li>Please see&nbsp;Section 8.H&nbsp;for the cancellation procedures applicable to Remittance Transfers.</li>
<li>Except for Remittance Transfers, if you direct us to begin processing a transfer immediately or a transfer's status is In Process or Processed, you no longer have the right to cancel it. However, the Bank at its option, may attempt to cancel the transaction, subject to the limitations in Section 8.G below.</li>
<li>Alternative Method: The easiest and most convenient way to cancel a transfer is through the method described above. However, you also may request to cancel a 1-time future-dated or recurring domestic transfer&nbsp;by calling us at 1.800.933.6262. From outside of the continental U.S., call us collect at: 1.925.681.7600.</li>
<li>If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. You may not call and cancel a transfer whose status is In Process or Processed.</li>
<li>If you attempt to cancel a payment or transfer in accordance with the above instructions and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages, subject to the limitations in Section 8.G&nbsp;below.</li>

<li>If you transfer funds to an account owned by you or someone else at another financial institution, the following transfer fees will apply:<br />- 3-Business-Day transfers - $3<br />- Next-Business-Day transfers - $10</li>
<li>Same-Business Day domestic transfers - varies by region (The actual fee disclosure is on the Transfers page.)</li>

In the event we determine that there are risks associated with a transfer or if we determine you are subject to a "Disqualifying Event," as defined below, we may delay or cancel the transfer and notify you, or direct you to contact us to provide additional details on the transfer before it is initiated or funds are released.</li>

					F. Processing Transfers and Disqualifying Events
			</h4>
		</div>
			<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>A transfer remains "In Process" until fully processed and it will appear as "In Process" on your Transfer Activity tab under Send Money To/From my accounts at other banks, or To someone else using an account number, within Online Banking. Transfers remain "In Process" until the close of business on the day the funds are scheduled to be credited to the receiving account.</li>
<li>For inbound transfers, 3-Business-Day delivery speed is available to all consumer customers participating in Transfers under Send Money To/From my accounts at other banks, or To someone else using an account number, within&nbsp;Online Banking, but you agree we may cancel a transfer, without prior notice, upon the occurrence of a "Disqualifying Event," as defined below. You must be approved to make a Next-Business-Day inbound transfer. Next-Business-Day inbound transfers are permitted only at our discretion, but you must have completed at least one 3-Business-Day inbound transfer involving the same non-Bank of America account no less than 60 days prior to the attempted Next-Business-Day inbound transfer. You may determine whether you have been approved for Next-Business-Day inbound transfers by going to Transfers under Send Money To/From my accounts at other banks, or To someone else using an account number within Online Banking and selecting Make a Transfer, then verify if the Next Business Day option is available once an account you own at another financial institution is selected. Once approved, you will remain eligible for Next-Business-Day inbound transfers, as applicable, unless we provide you with notice, as required by law.</li>
<li>We may change your dollar limits at any time. Any decrease will be subject to notice, as required by law, but you agree that we may reduce your limits below the amounts stated above or cancel your transfers without prior notice upon occurrence of a Disqualifying Event.</li>
<li>Each of the following is a "Disqualifying Event":
<ul class="tc-circle">
<li>Any of your deposit accounts with Bank of America are not current or are not in good standing.</li>
<li>Your funding account has been open for less than 24 hours.</li>
<li>You have had an overdraft, an over-limit item, or an item returned for insufficient funds with respect to any Bank of America deposit account during the current or 3 prior calendar months.</li>
<li>You have had any prior transfer canceled, revoked, or uncompleted due to insufficient funds, revoked authorization, stopped payments, frozen accounts, or any similar reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank of America will use best efforts to provide oral, written or electronic notice to you of rejection of a transfer on the scheduled date of initiation of the transfer; provided, however, that Bank of America shall not be liable to you for interest compensation for its failure to give such notice.</p>

					G. Liability

		</div>
			<p class="mtop-15"><strong><strong>The following applies to Same-Business Day Domestic transfers, and all Transfers Outside of Bank of America from a business account. The liability for Three-Business Day domestic transfers and Next-Business Day domestic transfers involving a transfer to or from a Bank of America consumer account is described in Section 5 above. The liability for Remittance Transfers is described in Section 8.H. below.</strong></strong></p>
<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>By enrolling in online banking and accessing the Transfers Outside Bank of America Service using your Online ID and&nbsp;passcode, you acknowledge and agree that this system includes security procedures for transfers initiated through this Service that are commercially reasonable. You agree to be bound by instructions, whether authorized or unauthorized, which we implement in compliance with these procedures, unless you have given us prior notice of possible unauthorized use of your passcode and we had a reasonable opportunity to act on such notice.</li>
<li>If we fail or delay in making a transfer pursuant to your instructions, or if we make a transfer in an erroneous amount that is less than the amount per your instructions, unless otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, our liability shall be limited to interest on the amount that we failed to timely pay or transfer, calculated from the date on which the payment or transfer was to be made until the date it was actually made or you canceled the instructions. We may pay such interest either to you or the intended recipient of the transfer, but in no event will we be liable to both parties, and our payment to either party will fully discharge any obligation to the other. If we make a payment or transfer in an erroneous amount that exceeds the amount per your instructions, or if we permit an unauthorized payment or transfer after we have had a reasonable time to act on a notice from you of possible unauthorized use of your passcode as described in this Section above, unless otherwise required by law or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, our liability will be limited to a refund of the amount erroneously paid or transferred, plus interest thereon from the date of the transfer to the date of the refund, but in no event to exceed 60 days' interest. If we become liable to you for interest compensation under this Agreement or applicable law, such interest shall be calculated based on the average federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve Bank in the district where Bank of America is headquartered for each day interest is due, computed on the basis of a 360-day year. <strong>Unless otherwise required by law, in no event will Bank of America be liable to you for special, indirect or consequential damages including, without limitation, loss or damage from subsequent wrongful dishonor resulting from our acts or omissions or lost profits, even if we are advised in advance of the possibility of such damages. </strong>We shall not be liable for your attorney's fees, except as required by law.</li>
<li>You expressly agree that Bank of America shall be liable to you only for our negligent performance or non-performance of the services provided pursuant to the Transfers Outside Bank of America Service, and that our responsibility shall be limited to the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care. Unless otherwise required by law, Bank of America shall not be liable for any error or delay on the part of any third party or for any other act or omission of any third party, including without limitation third parties used by Bank of America in executing any payment order relating to a transfer or performing a related act, and no such third party shall be deemed to be our agent. Further, we shall not be liable to you or any third party for failure to execute any transfer or perform a related act if such a failure is due to causes or conditions beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, strikes, riots, insurrection, war, military, or national emergencies, acts of God, natural disasters, fire, outages of computers or associated equipment, or failure of transportation or communication methods or power supplies. <strong>Except as may be limited by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Bank of America and officers, directors, employees and representatives harmless (including payment of reasonable attorney's fees) against any and all liability to third parties arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Transfers Outside Bank of America Service or any actions taken by Bank of America pursuant to your instructions.</strong></li>
<li>For each transfer, we will e-mail a confirmation to you at the e-mail address indicated in our records. The confirmation will note the date and the amount of the transfer and the bank or institution to or from which the transfer was made. You agree to examine the confirmation promptly upon receipt and to notify us immediately of any discrepancy between the confirmation and your records. Bank of America shall not be liable for interest compensation, as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, unless Bank of America is notified of the discrepancy within 30 days from the date of your receipt of the confirmation or your bank statement including the transfer, whichever is earlier.</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that if a payment order relating to a transfer describes a beneficiary inconsistently by name and account number, payment might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of the account number, even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary, and that your obligation to pay the transfer issued by you to us shall not be excused by such payment.</li>
<li>Bank of America may at its option accept your cancellations or amendments to a transfer. You acknowledge that if Bank of America attempts to cancel or amend a transfer, then the reversal request or amendment must be agreed to by each financial institution which has accepted a payment order related to the transfer at issue before it will be acted upon and you further agree that Bank of America shall have no liability if a cancellation or amendment is not completed. <strong>You agree that you shall indemnify and hold Bank of America and officers, directors, employees, and representatives harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, resulting directly or indirectly from compliance with your cancellation or amendment request</strong><strong>.</strong></li>

					H. Special Rules for Remittance Transfers
			</h4>

<ul class="tc-disc">
<li>As described above, a Remittance Transfer is an electronic transfer of funds initiated by a consumer primarily for personal, family or household purposes to a designated recipient in a foreign country.&nbsp;Beginning on the Effective Date, as defined above, federal law provides certain rights and obligations related to Remittance Transfers that may differ from rights and obligations that apply to other types of funds transfers, including disclosure, cancellation and error resolution rights. Your rights with respect to Remittance Transfers will be explained to you in a disclosure provided to you at the time you initiate each Remittance Transfer.</li>
<li>At the time you request a Remittance Transfer, but before your account is debited, you will be shown a pre-payment disclosure that includes the following items in the currency in which the transfer will be funded: (i) your requested transfer amount, (ii) any fees or taxes we impose, (iii) the total amount of the transaction (which is the sum of (i) and (ii) above,) (iv) the exchange rate we will use in the event you tell us that the receiving account is denominated in a foreign currency and you identify such currency. In addition, if you identify the foreign currency in which the transfer is to be received and we are required to disclose fees imposed by third parties, the pre-payment disclosure will also include the following items in such foreign currency: (x) the requested transfer amount, (y) the fees imposed by third parties in connection with the transfer, and (z) the total amount to be received by the recipient (which is the difference between (x) and (y) above.) Please note the recipient may receive less than the total amount disclosed due to foreign taxes and fees charged by the recipient&rsquo;s financial institution for receiving a Remittance Transfer into an account, which are not required to be disclosed.</li>
<li>Once you confirm your acceptance of the Remittance Transfer terms, you will be shown a receipt which includes the items listed above and, in addition, (i) the date the funds will be available to the recipient, (ii) information you provide that identifies the recipient, and (iii) a statement of your rights in the event of an error or if you wish to cancel the transfer, as described below.</li>
<li>Pre-payment disclosures and receipts may be printed directly in Transfers under the Transfer Activity tab in Send Money To/From my accounts at other banks, or To someone else using an account number, within Online Banking.</li>
<li><strong>You are hereby notified that in the event that you provide an incorrect account number or institutional identifying number, and we are not able to recover the funds, you may lose the amount of the payment order.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>If you think there has been an error or problem with your Remittance Transfer:</strong></strong></p>
<p>Call us at 1.877.337.8357; or, from outside the U.S. call us collect at 302.781.6374.</p>

<li>The name of the person receiving the funds, and if you know it, his or her telephone number or address;</li>
<li>The dollar amount of the transfer; and</li>
<li>The confirmation code or number of the transaction.</li>

We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of any documents we used in our investigation.</p>
<p><strong>What to do if you want to cancel a Remittance Transfer:</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to cancel a Remittance Transfer and obtain a refund of all funds paid to us, including any fees, within 30 minutes of your confirmation of the transfer.

					I. Additional Rules for International Outbound Transfers
			</h4>
		</div>
			<ul>
<li>Once an international outbound transfer has been sent, or, in the case of Remittance Transfers, after the 30 minute cancellation period has passed, you may request that a transfer be recalled, and we will communicate your request to the beneficiary's bank. If the beneficiary's bank agrees to return the funds to us, then upon confirmation of receipt of funds in our account, we will credit your account at the current Bank of America retail buy rate for that currency that day (see below). Please note that the exchange rate will be different from the original rate applicable to the transfer, which may result in a loss to you. Furthermore, the beneficiary's bank may assess charges for their services, which will be deducted from the amount returned to you. Except for Remittance Transfers that you cancel prior to the end of the 30 minute cancellation period, we will have no liability to you if the beneficiary's bank or foreign beneficiary refuses your request to recall the international wire transfer.</li>
<li>If a transfer is returned by the receiving bank or beneficiary's bank for no fault of ours, we will credit your account at the current Bank of America retail buy rate for the currency that day (see below). Please note that the exchange rate will be different from the original rate applicable to the transfer, which may result in a loss to you. Furthermore, a returning bank and/or beneficiary's bank may assess charges for their services, which will be deducted from the amount returned to you.</li>
<li>The exchange rate that Bank of America will offer you or assign to your transaction is determined by Bank of America based upon market conditions. We consider many factors in setting our exchange rates including without limitation exchange rates charged by other parties, desired rates of return, market risk and credit risk. You acknowledge that exchange rates for retail and commercial transactions, and for transactions effected after regular business hours and on weekends, are different from the exchange rates for large inter-bank transactions effected during the business day as reported in The Wall Street Journal or elsewhere. Exchange rates offered by other dealers, or shown at other sources (including online sources) may be different from Bank of America's rates. We do not accept any liability if our rates are different from rates offered or reported by third parties, or offered by us at a different time, at a different location, for a different transaction amount, or involving a different payment media (banknotes, check, wire transfer etc.) For Remittance Transfers, as of the Effective date defined above, the exchange rate to be applied to the transfer will be set forth in disclosures provided to you for the transfer in accordance with federal law.</li>

				9. BankAmeriDeals<sup>&reg;</sup>
		</h3>
	</div>
	
		<p><br />BankAmeriDeals ("deals" or "cash back deals" or "offers") are provided pursuant to these terms and conditions and any operating rules or policies that may be published by Bank of America (including its Privacy Notice), as may be amended from time to time. BankAmeriDeals provide you with the opportunity to earn cash back with deals based on your use of your eligible Bank of America accounts. If you are a customer who has a U.S. address listed as your primary residence in your Online Banking profile, has an eligible debit or credit card and meets the BankAmeriDeals other eligibility requirements, the deals recommended for you will appear in your Account Detail transaction list in Online Banking and on the Cash Back Deals tab in Online Banking or on the Deals tab in the Bank of America Mobile Banking App. We try to match deals to the places you've shopped or to similar places that might interest you. We do not share individually identifiable information with merchants as part of BankAmeriDeals, and we offer you the opportunity to hide or opt out of receiving these cash back deals. As always, we will only use personally identifiable information in accordance with our <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/Control.do?body=privacysecur_onlin" title="www.bankofamerica.com" name="www.bankofamerica.com">Online Privacy Notice</a> and <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/Control.do?body=privacysecur_cnsmr" title="www.bankofamerica.com" name="www.bankofamerica.com">U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice.</a></p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend, cancel, change, discontinue, or suspend BankAmeriDeals, in whole or in part, at any time in our discretion with or without notice to you, and any such action shall be effective as of the time we determine. However, in all instances, we will provide cash back in accordance with the terms of this Section (BankAmeriDeals) for all deals redeemed prior to the action.</p>
		<div class="h-100">
			<h4 id="cat9_topic1">
					A. Redeeming BankAmeriDeals
			</h4>
		</div>
			<p><br />In order to redeem a cash back deal you must first click on the deal to load it to your eligible Bank of America credit and debit cards and then complete the transaction using one of those cards. The amount of cash back and any specific terms and conditions related to a particular deal will be included in the deals details . However, cash back will not be earned for any portion of your purchase that you pay for with store credit, gift certificates or other payment types. Additionally, transactions must be made directly with the merchant to earn the cash back; you may not receive cash back in connection with a deal if your transaction is made using an electronic wallet where the identity of the merchant is not passed to us as part of the transaction.<br /><br />Cash back you earn will be posted into the account designated as your cash back account ("Designated Account") on the <strong>Preferences</strong> tab in the Cash Back Deals section of Online Banking or under <strong>BankAmeriDeals</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> in the Mobile Banking App. You may change the Designated Account to another eligible account at any time by clicking the <strong>Change account</strong> link in Online Banking or tapping the <strong>Cash Back Account</strong> button in the Mobile Banking App. (An account will be auto-populated at random&nbsp;as the default account to receive your BankAmeriDeals cash back unless you access the <strong>Preferences</strong> or <strong>Settings</strong> tab and select another account. This could mean that cash back earned through use of a business card might be deposited into your consumer account as the default, for example.)<br /><br />Cash back from the BankAmeriDeals you redeem in a given month will appear as transaction(s) on the Account Details page for your Designated Account and will appear in your Earnings Summary in the Mobile Banking App. Your BankAmeriDeals cash back will typically be credited to your account within 30 days after you redeem the deal. For example, any deals you redeem in the month of December should be credited to your account by the end of January. Since we don't share your personal information with merchants as part of BankAmeriDeals, we cannot post the cash back reward to your account immediately at the time of purchase and there may be a delay for your cash back reward to show&nbsp;to be paid&nbsp;on the <strong>Cash Back Deals Earned</strong> tab in Online Banking or in the<strong> Earnings Summary</strong> in the Mobile Banking App. If you would like to see the BankAmeriDeals you have redeemed or the total value of the deals you have redeemed to date, please visit the <strong>Earned</strong> tab in Online Banking or the <strong>Earnings Summary</strong> in the Mobile Banking App.<br /><br />Cash back posted to a credit card account will not be posted as a payment. It will be posted as a statement credit and is not a substitute for a payment. You must continue to make your minimum monthly payment shown on your billing statement.<br /><br />Your Designated Account must be open in order to receive BankAmeriDeals cash payments. If your Designated Account is closed but you have other open eligible cards/accounts, we reserve the right to select an alternative Designated Account for you. You can go to the <strong>Preferences</strong> tab in Online Banking or to <strong>BankAmeriDeals</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> in the Mobile Banking App to update or change your Designated Account. If all of your eligible cards/accounts are closed by you or us, you forfeit any BankAmeriDeals cash payments that you have not yet been awarded.</p>

		<p>The FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program is provided pursuant to these terms and conditions and the other applicable terms and conditions of this Online Banking Service Agreement, as each may be amended from time to time. The FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program gives you the opportunity to view your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score 8 (&ldquo;FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score&rdquo;) credit score in Online Banking at no charge, along with two key factors affecting that particular FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score. FICO is a registered trademark of the Fair Isaac Corporation (&ldquo;Fair Isaac&rdquo;) in the United States and other countries. This FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score is solely determined by the information in your file at TransUnion (one of the three major consumer reporting agencies) and is created using Fair Isaac&rsquo;s proprietary model. Your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score may vary from consumer reporting agency to consumer reporting agency and other lenders may use scores from one or more of the other two major consumer reporting agencies. TransUnion and Fair Isaac are third parties not affiliated with Bank of America and Bank of America makes no representation or warranty related to the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score.</p>
<p>Bank of America is providing you access to your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score and related content only for educational purposes and your personal, non-commercial use. Only Bank of America customers with an eligible consumer credit card account (e.g., an open account with active charging privileges) may enroll in the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program. At this time, the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program is not available through all Bank of America's Downloadable Mobile Banking Applications ("Mobile Banking Apps"). We reserve the right to amend, cancel, change, discontinue, or suspend the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program and/or your access to it, in whole or in part, at any time in our discretion with or without notice to you, and any such action shall be effective as of the time we determine.</p>

			<p>By enrolling in the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program, you authorize Bank of America to access your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Scores that we may already have based upon our relationships with you and/or to obtain your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score periodically from TransUnion. Once we obtain your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score it will be available to you in Online Banking for your educational and non-commercial use. Viewing your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score as a part of the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program will not negatively impact your score.</p>
<p>Your enrollment provides your authorization in writing for us to obtain your credit report under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable law. <strong>If you choose to enroll in the FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score Program, please be aware that all of your Online IDs and individuals who have access to your Online Banking profile will be able to view your FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score</strong>. You can un-enroll at any time by going to the <strong>Tools and Investing</strong> tab in Online Banking.</p>

Customers with newly opened credit card accounts may not see their first FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score in Online Banking for up to 60 days after enrollment. In certain circumstances, a FICO<sup>&reg;</sup> Score may not be available from TransUnion for various reasons, e.g., having a limited credit history.

									<h3>Advertising Practices</h3>
										<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
<p>To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_PrivacyNotice" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go" target="_blank">Bank of America Online Privacy Notice</a> and our <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="Online-privacy-faqs" href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/faq/online-privacy-faq.go" target="_blank">Online Privacy FAQs</a>.</p>
